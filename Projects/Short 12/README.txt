For this project I decided that the simplest way to accomplish what I was trying to do is to simply add some stuff to the list node class. 
It still functions as a linked list, it just has two additional fields for the nodes x and y position on the grid. If the program is run without my modified 
linked list class, it will run a non graphical version of the insert.

When using the terminal to enter new nodes, 'exit' can be entered to break the loop
